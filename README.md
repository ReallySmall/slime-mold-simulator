# Slime Mold Simulator
An experiment in mimicking slime mold growth and movement in JS

Planned functionality:

1/ Upload any image
2/ Create object from image, converting pixel RGB values to density values symbolising areas of, and routes to, food, and inhospitable areas
3/ Drag and drop initial mold spores onto any area of the image
4/ Spores should then grow and move organically, following easiest routes to food sources
5/ Food sources should diminish as consumed
